###### I'm a fan of Open Source, so I will eventually release my app here on GitHub once I am happy with my code. Since I am still learning Android Development, I do not want to release bad code (because it will influence new programmers). I also do not want someone else to improve my code since that would interfere with my learning experience. I understand that this contradict the whole idea of collaborative programming, but I want to achieve the basics by doing it myself.
